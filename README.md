# Python  PLC Honey Pot Project [under development]

![](doc/img/logo.png)



We want to create a python PLC honey pot system with below features:

### 1. **PLC Emulator**

- **Protocol Emulation**: Simulates communication protocols (e.g., Modbus, S7Comm, DNP3, EtherNet/IP) to make the honeypot behave like a real PLC.
- **Control Logic Simulation**: Mimics control logic processing to respond to commands realistically, including simulating I/O operations and process control behavior.
- **Configurable Device Profile**: Allows customization of device settings like model type, firmware version, and IP address to imitate various real-world PLCs.

### 2. **Network Interface**

- **IP Configuration**: Allows the honeypot to be discovered on the network, acting like a real PLC.
- **Vulnerability Simulation**: Creates intentional vulnerabilities (e.g., open ports, weak authentication) to lure attackers.
- **Network Visibility**: Integrates with network infrastructure to monitor and capture traffic directed to the honeypot.

### 3. **Data Logger and Monitor**

- **Interaction Logging**: Records all communications, including commands sent by attackers, responses given by the honeypot, and any unauthorized access attempts.
- **Packet Capturing**: Captures network traffic for deeper analysis of attack methods.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Enables real-time tracking of interactions, allowing administrators to observe and respond to incidents.

### 4. **Alerting and Notification System**

- **Automated Alerts**: Sends notifications to administrators when specific events or suspicious activities are detected (e.g., repeated login attempts, abnormal commands).
- **Event-Based Triggers**: Configurable to trigger alerts based on predefined rules, making it easier to detect ongoing attacks.

### 5. **Attack Analysis and Forensics Module**

- **Data Analysis Tools**: Analyzes captured data to identify patterns and techniques used by attackers.
- **Forensic Data Collection**: Gathers evidence, including packet traces, command logs, and system behavior, for post-incident analysis.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on detected activities, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

### 6. **Deception Layer**

- **Fake System Environment**: Simulates a larger network or industrial setup, creating the illusion of a more complex control system to engage attackers.
- **Bait Mechanisms**: Includes features like fake data, open services, and apparent vulnerabilities to make the system more appealing to attackers.

### 7. **Integration with Security Infrastructure**

- **SIEM Integration**: Connects with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for centralized logging, alerting, and analysis.
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Shares information on detected threats with threat intelligence platforms, helping to build a broader defense strategy.

### 8. **Management Console**

- **Configuration Management**: Provides a user interface to set up, configure, and control various aspects of the honeypot.
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Displays real-time data and alerts, allowing security teams to manage and analyze the honeypot's performance.
- **Remote Access**: Enables administrators to manage the system remotely, ensuring flexibility in monitoring and response.

These components work together to create a **comprehensive PLC honeypot system** that not only mimics real PLCs but also effectively captures attacker behaviors, gathers intelligence, and enhances the overall security posture of industrial environments.
